About Us
Established in 2009 and sponsored by the Deer Isle Firemans Association, Slim’s Fishing Derby is the signature fundraising event for the Jimmy Douglass Memorial Scholarship.

Slim’s Fishing Derby holds an annual ice fishing derby across all of Hancock County when the ice is at its best, typically in early February.  Anglers come from all over the county, state, and even New England to attend this great event.

We are committed to the promotion of safe and responsible fishing to the current and next generation of sportsman.
